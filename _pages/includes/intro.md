I work at [Zhejiang Lab, AI Team](https://www.zhejianglab.com/) <img src='./images/zjlab.png' style='width: 6em;'> as a research scientist now in Hangzhou, leading a AI research group. 

I am now working on Multi-modal(view) Learning, Information Retrieval, and Pattern Recognition. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [qijian.zhu@outlook.com](mailto:qijian.zhu@outlook.com).

I am pursuing a doctoral degree at the School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China. My doctoral supervisor is [DAI lirong (戴礼荣)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou).



I won the [Baidu Scholarship](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E5%A5%96%E5%AD%A6%E9%87%91/9929412) (10 candidates worldwide each year) and [ByteDance Scholars Program](https://ur.bytedance.com/scholarship) (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2020 and was selected as one of [the top 100 AI Chinese new stars](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4NzQ5MTA2NA==&mid=2653639431&idx=1&sn=25b6368c1954419b9090840347d9a27d&chksm=8be75b90bc90d286a5af3ef8e610e822d705dc3cf4382b45e3f14489f3e7ec4fd8c95ed0eceb&mpshare=1&scene=2&srcid=0511LMlj9Qv9DeIZAjMjYAU9&sharer_sharetime=1620731348139&sharer_shareid=631c113940cb81f34895aa25ab14422a#rd) and AI Chinese New Star Outstanding Scholar (10 candidates worldwide each year). 

My research interest includes Multi-modal(view) Learning, Information Retrieval, Pattern Recognition. I have published 5+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zYrKCHIAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as ICME, APWEB-WAIM. 

To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the [MLNLP community](https://space.bilibili.com/168887299) in 2021. I am honored to be one of the chairs of the MLNLP committee.
